# LLM Super Prompt

A personal reference repository documenting a methodology for crafting high-quality prompts for large language models (LLMs). This repo captures patterns, examples, and small HTML/JS playgrounds to test prompt ideas quickly.

## What this is
- Personal notes and experiments about prompt design and structure.
- Small interactive examples (HTML + JS) to validate prompt behaviors in the browser.
- Lightweight, for personal use and iterative improvement.

## Quick start
1. Open the HTML files in your browser to view/play with examples.
2. Edit prompt examples in the HTML/JS files and refresh to test changes.

## Structure
- / — project root with README and experiment files
- *.html — interactive prompt playgrounds and examples
- *.js — helper scripts used by the playgrounds

## Goals
- Capture repeatable prompt patterns and templates.
- Provide easy-to-run examples for rapid testing.
- Serve as a personal handbook for prompt engineering.

## Notes
This is a personal use project. Please feel free to ask or consider partnering.
